## Motivation
Dimensionality reduction in the currency markets could bring significant benefits, without any sacrifice of data. We can reduce the 28 "major" pairs into their component eight currencies.
Graphically, we would be reducing this ${8 \choose 2}$ chart clutter:  
![](28pairs.PNG)

into a more manageable dataset of eight charts:  
![](8currenSinglets.PNG)

Of course, the benefits of this process reach considerably beyond visual elegance. The $n$ for any analysis (along with its required resources) - whether automatic or manual - could be cut down by more than two thirds. And as we will see [later](https://rpubs.com/Shahar/ts), this analysis will be performed on a refined, reduced-noise data set.

## Dimensionality reduction
Raw tick and minute data (currency pairs: bid and ask) were processed after downloading from a forex broker using their platform.

The reduction in dimensionality manifests more clearly when aggregating all currency pairs - or all currencies - inside one data frame. Then, each tick, minute, or hour (depending on the required time frame) can be seen as a new data point.
Consequently, every currency pair or currency - as attributes of that specific point in time - would have a different price (technically four more prices, corresponding to Open, High, Low, and Close - or even twice that if one accounts for bid and ask separately - but let's keep ignore these for the sake of simplicity).
The following code puts all of the M1 currency _pair_ data into one time frame, and all of the M1 _currency_ data into another - and shows the dimensionality reduction from 28t to 8t (t is the number of points in the time series). It then presents a visual of the reduction in file size.
```{r}
library(xts)
insts <- c("AUD", "NZD", "EUR", "GBP", "CAD", "CHF", "JPY", "USD")

currency <- xts()
pair <- xts()
merge_currency <- function(instrument) {
  r <- readRDS(paste0(".\\M1\\", instrument, '2020M1.rds'))[,4]
  colnames(r) <- instrument
  return(r)
}

for (c1 in insts) {
  currency <- na.locf(na.locf(merge(currency, merge_currency(c1), join="right"),
                              fromLast = TRUE))
  for (c2 in insts) {
    c12 <- paste0(c1, c2)
    f <- paste0(".\\M1\\", c12, '2020M1.rds')
    if (file.exists(f)) {
      pair <- merge(pair, merge_currency(c12), join="right")
    }
  }
}
pair[endpoints(pair, on="quarters"),]
print(dim(pair)[2])
currency[endpoints(currency, on="quarters"),]
print(dim(currency)[2])

df <- data.frame(Instrument=character(), Size=integer(), Type=character())

merge_currency <- function(instrument, df) {
  pc <- "Currency"
  if (nchar(instrument) > 3) pc <- "Currency pair"
  f <- paste0(".\\M1\\", instrument, '2020M1.rds')
  d <- list(Instrument=instrument, Size=file.info(f)$size / 2^20, Type=pc)
  df <- rbind(d, df, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
  return(df)
}

for (c1 in insts) {
  df <- merge_currency(c1, df)
  for (c2 in insts) {
    c12 <- paste0(c1, c2)
    f <- paste0(".\\M1\\", c12, '2020M1.rds')
    if (file.exists(f)) {
      df <- merge_currency(c12, df)
    }
  }
}

df$Type <- factor(df$Type, levels=c("Currency pair", "Currency"))

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(df, aes(fill=Instrument, y=Size, x=Type)) + 
  geom_bar(position="stack", stat="identity") +
  xlab(NULL) + ylab("File size [MB]")
```


## How do we know that the resulting data are indeed equivalent?
Let's test if we can recreate the pairs. For example, let's examine the "original" NZD/USD (as downloaded from the broker), against the "artificial" NZD/USD, constructed by dividing our NZD index by our USD index:
```{r echo=-1}
# CompareActualSynthetic.r
library(ggplot2)
library(ggtext)
library(xts)

base.currency <- "NZD"
quote.currency <- "USD"
pair <- paste0(base.currency, quote.currency)

# On first run only:
# nzdusd <- readRDS(paste0(base.currency, ".rds"))$Bid /
#           readRDS(paste0(quote.currency, ".rds"))$Bid
# saveRDS(nzdusd, file="SyntheticNZDUSDticks.rds")

# nzdusd 	<- na.locf(na.locf(
#   merge(readRDS(paste0(".\\Daily\\", pair, '.rds'))[,4],
#         to.daily(readRDS("SyntheticNZDUSDticks.rds"))[,4])), fromLast = TRUE)
# colnames(nzdusd) <- c("Actual", "Synthetic")
# saveRDS(nzdusd, file=(paste0(".\\Daily\\", "ActualSyntheticNZDUSD.rds")))
nzdusd <- readRDS(paste0(".\\Daily\\", "ActualSyntheticNZDUSD.rds"))

d <- data.frame(
  day = as.Date(index(nzdusd)),
  Actual <- nzdusd[,1],
  Synthetic <- nzdusd[,2]
)

daily_close <- ggplot(d) +
  geom_line(mapping=aes(x=day, y=Actual, color="Actual"),
            linetype="dashed", size=1) +
  geom_line(mapping=aes(x=day, y=Synthetic, color="Synthetic"),
            linetype="dotted", size=1) +
  scale_color_manual(values
                     = c('Actual' = 'aquamarine', 'Synthetic' = 'seagreen')) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "NZD/USD", color = "Market",
    title = "Actual vs synthetic daily close for 2020",
    subtitle = paste0("*Synthetic* data represented as dots ",
                      "to visually separate from *actual* market data"))
daily_close + theme(plot.subtitle = ggtext::element_markdown())
mean_dif <- mean(Actual - Synthetic)
print(mean_dif)
print(paste0(round(100 * mean_dif / mean(Actual), 3), '%'))
```

The two time series are virtually indistinguishable: the mean difference is only about 15 millionths of one dollar, amounting to about 0.002% of the mean exchange rate.

Now that we have shown that the reduced data set is equivalent to the original, let's examine an important advantage the former has over the latter: [lower noise](https://rpubs.com/Shahar/ts).
